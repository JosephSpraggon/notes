## 1. Creating Testing Framework

We are instructed to create a testing framework that does not rely on any libraries (except HTTP_Server). To do so, we constructed a basic testing framework out of pure JavaScript, using the following template:

```
let ready = (callback) => {
  if (document.readyState != "loading") callback();
  else document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", callback);

  function testIfPageTitleIncludesTitleText() {
    let title = document.getElementById("title")

    if (title.textContent.includes("My Notes")) {
      console.log("Title includes \"My Notes\".")
    }
    else {
      throw new Error("Title does not include \"My Notes\".")
    };
  };

  ready(() => {
    testIfPageTitleIncludesTitleText();
  });
}
```

## 2. Parsing User Stories

### Headline Specifications

Actions are *italic*. Nouns are **bold**. Attributes of nouns are **_bold italics_**.

##### User Story 01

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a programmer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can *see a list* of my **notes**, where each **note** is *abbreviated to the first 20 characters*,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I can find the one I want.

##### User Story 02

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a programmer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can create a **new note**,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I can record something I need to remember.

##### User Story 03

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a programmer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can *see the full text of an individual note* on its **own page**,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I can see all the information in the note.

##### User Story 04

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a programmer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can *use shortcodes* like `:fire:` that get converted into **emojis** like ðŸ”¥,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I can record notes with fun little pictures.

##### User Story 05

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a programmer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can refresh the page and still see my notes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I can remember what I took down.
